# PHP Gallery

Photo gallery, created with PHP and MySQL. As a Web developer it is very likely that they will request projects of this type ["CRUD"], where we can create, read, update and delete data in a database.

A simple design with which they could be cooked for future projects, the intention is to give an idea of how they could do it and save time.
